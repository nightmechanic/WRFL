This is the reposirory for my Water Rocket flight logger a.k.a WRFL.

The WRFL project is based on the Texas Instruments' TM4C123GXL LaunchPad.
The project will (hopefully...) consist of HW development of a dedicated "BoosterPack" ( a shield for all you Arduino fans) and acompanying Firmware.

The BoosterPack will have a barometer for altitude measurments, an accelerometer, flash memory, LCD dispaly and buttons for UI, servo connectors, baterry charger and required power management.

The firmware will run all the above :)
